## Record Grain

One row represents one historical support ticket and its assigned department. The dataset does not document when or how `Priority` and `Tags` were created.

## Schema

All fields are read from the CSV as strings.

| Field | Role | Missing | Distinct values | Description |
| :---- | :---- | ----: | ----: | :---- |
| `ticket_id` | Identifier | 0 | 29,651 | Stable one-based row number added for this course |
| `Body` | Ticket text | 1 | 25,055 | Natural-language support request |
| `Department` | Assignment | 0 | 10 | Assigned department |
| `Priority` | Source metadata | 0 | 3 | Source-provided ticket priority |
| `Tags` | Source metadata | 0 | 12,946 | Source-provided serialized ticket tags |

Distinct-value counts include the missing `Body` value.

## Routing Labels

## Known Data Facts

- Exactly one record has a missing `Body`.  
- No record has a missing `ticket_id`, `Department`, `Priority`, or `Tags`.  
- `ticket_id` is unique for every record.  
- Repeated `Body` values exist.  
- The counts above describe the supplied CSV.

## Preparation

The Kaggle CSV contained an unnamed exported row-index column. It was replaced with `ticket_id` values from 1 through 29,651. The other four fields and all source rows were preserved without cleaning or correction.
