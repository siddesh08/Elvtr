# Homework 2 \- Prepare Data and Establish Baselines

## Goal

Build a reusable classifier for this task:

> Given a newly arrived support ticket, predict the department that should receive it.

You will curate the provided dataset, create a deterministic train/validation/test split, implement preprocessing, and build three routing baselines. This homework checks that the complete modeling workflow runs; formal model evaluation begins in Homework 3\.

## Provided Materials

You receive a canonical dataset derived from [IT Support Ticket Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parthpatil256/it-support-ticket-data), version 1, published June 14, 2025 under the MIT License.

| File | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- |
| `support_tickets.csv` | Immutable canonical dataset |
| `DATASET_CARD.md` | Source, schema, field roles, and dataset summary |
| `ml_baseline_output_example.json` | Required ML-baseline prediction output example |
| `requirements.txt` | Pinned dependencies for Python 3.14.7 |

Treat the dataset as immutable: read it from your code, but do not overwrite or hand-edit it.

`DATASET_CARD.md` provides the dataset's row grain, field roles, missing-value counts, cardinalities, and routing-label distribution. Use that supplied summary rather than repeating the broad dataset profiling from Homework 1\.

## Task 1 \- Clean the Data

Prepare the supplied data for splitting and modeling. Identify relevant record-level quality issues and decide which to change, retain, or defer.

### Requirements

- Implement deterministic text cleaning in code.  
- Do not use pre-defined text-cleaning libraries.  
- Produce a cleaned dataset with the same `ticket_id`.  
- For each decision, record representative `ticket_id` values, the action and reason, the affected count, and one risk or limitation.

### Deliverables

- Cleaning code.  
- Cleaned dataset.  
- Cleaning writeup containing, for each cleaning decision:  
  - What the issue was.  
  - Why you consider it an issue.  
  - How you addressed the issue.  
  - How many records are affected by the issue.  
  - Some representative ticket\_id's.  
  - Risks or limitations of your solution

## Task 2 \- Split the Data

Create reproducible train, validation, and test partitions from the cleaned dataset.

### Requirements

- Choose and justify the proportions, assignment strategy, and reproducibility parameters of your split policy.  
- Implement the assignment algorithm directly without a pre-built splitting function.  
- Algorithm should output a CSV with 2 columns: `ticket_id` and `split`. `split` is one of `train`, `validation`, or `test`.  
- Include automated integrity checks (e.g. make sure your splitting worked as expected).

### Deliverables

- Split-generation code.  
- Split verification code.  
- Manifest CSV.  
- Split writeup containing:  
  - Chosen proportions and rationale.  
  - Assignment strategy and reproducibility parameters.

## Task 3 \- Implement Preprocessing

Prepare the cleaned ticket-body for modeling.

### Requirements

- Take the cleaned dataset CSV and split manifest as inputs to construct the dataset-splits.  
- Define and implement the preprocessing for `Body` to produce feature vectors.  
- Decide whether and how to address class imbalance.  
- You can use pre-built utilities for text preprocessing.

### Deliverables

- Preprocessing code.  
- Preprocessing writeup containing:  
  - Input-field decisions and rationale.  
  - Preprocessing rationale.  
  - Class-imbalance decision and rationale.

## Task 4 \- Build an ML Baseline

Build one CPU-friendly classifier.

### Requirements

- Input: ticket `Body`.  
- Output: dictionary matching `ml_baseline_output_example.json`.  
  - Look at using `predict_proba` or `decision_function` (depends on model) to get the class scores.  
- Implement a single Python class with functions for:  
  - `fit()`: Trains the preprocessor and model  
  - `predict()`: Applies preprocessing to the ticket body and predicts the label  
  - `save()`: Saves the trained model to disk (use `joblib` Python lib)  
  - `load()`: Loads the trained model from disk  
- Ensure predictions are reproducible.  
- You may use scikit-learn for model training.

### Deliverables

- Python class code.  
- Persisted model artifact.  
- ML-baseline writeup containing:  
  - Text-featurization choice and rationale  
  - Model choice and rationale  
  - Percentage of training records predicted correctly
